Known Issues: 
-Merge doesn't work (compiles without errors but when you run it it never prints anything)
-Queens compiles forever, stuck in liveness phase
-Liveness doesn't terminate for some programs
-Register allocator doesn't implement spilling or coalescing, so we'll be unable to compile large programs

Testing:
-Arrays: Tested
-Records: Tested
-Lib functions:
    -print (x)
		-flush ()
		-getchar ()
		-size (x)
		-ord (x)
		-chr (x)
		-substring (x)
		-concat (x)
