Step 1: write findEscapes to set escape variables in ASTs  (ANITA)
Step 2: Start creating structures Translate and Frame based on chapters 6 and 7 (SAUMYA)
Step 2.5: (FIX TREE TO HAVE RELOP AND COMMUTE) (TOMMY)
Step 3: Modify FunEntry and VarEntry based on page 140, and modify Semant to use Translate as in chapter 6 (SAUMYA)
Step 4: Write unEx, unCx, unNx in Translate
Step 5: Write a function in Translate to translate simple variables (this involves handling static links)
Step 6: Modify Semant to use the simplevar function in Translate
Step 7: Write functions in Translate to generate IR for all different kinds of Tiger exps
Step 8: Modify Semant to call Translate functions
Step 9: Do fragment stuff??

Conceptually hard stuff: Getting started.



(-8 pts): there are several issues with type declarations:
1) you report the existence of an illegal cycle, but enter an infinite loop (see test16.tig)
2) you cannot handle array types - the compiler crashes reporting a Match failure, which is caused by non-exhaustive matches

FindEscape questions:
- Why do RecordTys have a list of fields that escape?
