Questions
1) Implementation using top and bottom for exhaustive type checking
2) Check for unit in all typechecks to prevent excessive error messages
3) Make nil subtype of all records
4) Error messages for everything
  - Error produced, but not propagated (return type UNIT)
5) Make sure we check type compatibility vs. actual type (example of unit vs. int)
6) Cycles in type decs??
7) Check records in trexp


Test Cases
1 var dec
1 type dec
1 fun dec

expressions (ALL)

list of var decs
list of type decs
list of fun decs

mutually recursive list of type decs
mutually recursive list of fun decs

nested scope
nested scope with same var/type names
