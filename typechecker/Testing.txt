How to test:
-CM.make "sources.cm";
-use "Semant.sml";
-val t = Env.base_tenv;
-val v = Env.base_venv;
-transExp(v,t) Parse.parse "Sample.tig"
-Look to see if transExp returns the correct Types.ty,
and whether it prints error messages in cases where it should


Things that return correct types and throw errors correctly:
NilExp
IntExp
StringExp
OpExp
IfExp
Declaring and using records
Declaring and using arrays
Recursive records
Mutually recursive records (tree, forest)

Things that have been tested partially:


Things to start testing:
-Function declarations and function calls
-For loops
-While loops


Things that have known bugs:
Sequences:
-Parser messes up sequences with <2 elements...
-Need to stop trseq from returning BOTTOM to user
