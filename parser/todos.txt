Grammar Sketchiness:
- double check if then precedence
- comma made left associative to avoid S/R conflicts in fieldec/funargs
-Need to double-check lvalues

function dec in absyn tree
functiondec mutually recursive list, fundec is one function same for types


Questions for Drew:
-Grammar sketchiness
-How to group fundecs and tydecs? Since they're not delimited by anything, it's hard
to create lists of them without getting shift/reduce conflicts.



THINGS THAT DONT WORK:
-If/then/else
-Still need to group decs

THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED AND APPEAR TO WORK:
-Sequences of expressions
-All different kinds of decs
-Most of the OpExps but not all
-Assign statements
-All different kinds of lvalues
-Function calls with multiple fields
-All different kinds of type declarations
-Complicated lvalues
-Function calls with many arguments
-Array initialization
-Record initialization
