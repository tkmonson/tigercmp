- double check if then precedence
- declist is sketchy af
- comma left associative???
- sequences in arguments for funcall
- mutually recursive tydec and fundec


Questions for Drew:
-Grammar sketchiness
-How to group fundecs and tydecs? Since they're not delimited by anything, it's hard
to create lists of them. Also, any solution would have to work with nested let statements.
-Some record types in Absyn.sml take an argument called escape. What is that?
-Double-check our implementation of lvalue grammar
