Semantic Value Questions:

Q1: How do you access a value returned from a previous semantic action?
For example, the grammar rule

decList: dec dec (dec1:dec2)

returns a list of decs.


In the grammar rule

decList: decList dec

I'd like to access the dec list associated with the decList, so that I could do decList:dec


Q2: How to group fundec, typedec?
