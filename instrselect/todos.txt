Semant.453: We call allocLocal on each function param. But, each param has already been alloc'd when
the function frame was created in processFunDecHead. This is causing duplicate InFrame/InReg accesses,
which is messing up the trees. Get rid of the calls to allocLocal in processFunDecBody!

(-3 pts): when UnNxing a Cx, you’re just returning the label, not the sequence of the condition and the label
(-2 pts): when translating a subscript expression, you’re not multiplying by the word size when indexing into memory
(-1 pt): string comparisons require a special external call (stringEqual, stringLT, stringGT)
(-2 pts): you risk entering an infinite loop when translating for loops when the upper limit is the integer maximum
(because Tiger for loops operate on closed intervals,
I’d recommend against converting it to a while loop and then using the while loop translation)
(-2 pts): when making a new level, you’re not adding whether the newest formal (the static link) escapes
