simplify:
-Create assembly that has several nodes of trivial degree, make sure that they all get removed
-Create assembly that has non-precolored temps of nontrivial (>= 28) degree, make sure that they don't get removed
  -Because of procEntryExit2, every temp will already interfere with at least 12 of the precolored temps.
  -Might actually be really hard to create a test case that does this? Probably not worth spending a ton of time on if it turns out to be really hard


colorSimpGraph:
-For a graph that has non-precolored temps that can't get simplified, make sure they get colored
  -Again, might be hard to make this happen in a testcase

select:
-Create simple programs, make sure that they get colored in a way that doesn't produce wrong assembly
-Create more complicated programs (function calls, loops, nested functions)
-Try and create a program that we can't allocate registers for
